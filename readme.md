## üîß Installation

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

Docker provides the easiest and most consistent way to run the application across different platforms.

#### Windows with Docker

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - Install [VcXsrv Windows X Server](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)

2. **Start VcXsrv**:
   - Launch XLaunch from Start menu
   - Select "Multiple windows" and click Next
   - Select "Start no client" and click Next
   - Check "Disable access control" (important) and uncheck "Native opengl", then click Next
   - Click Finish to start the X server

3. **Build and Run**:
   ```powershell
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t audio-analyzer .

   # Run the container with GUI support
   docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 -e QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb -v "${PWD}:/app" audio-analyzer
   ```

   **Note for Command Prompt**: Use `%cd%` instead of `${PWD}`:
   ```cmd
   docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 -e QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb -v "%cd%:/app" audio-analyzer
   ```

4. **Access Music Files**:
   To analyze music files stored elsewhere on your system, add an additional volume mount:
   ```powershell
   docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 -e QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb -v "${PWD}:/app" -v "D:/music:/music" audio-analyzer
   ```
   Then your music files will be available at `/music` in the container.

#### Ubuntu with Docker

1. **Install Docker**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker.io
   sudo systemctl start docker

   # Log out and back in for the group to take effect
   ```

2. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t audio-analyzer .

   # Run the container
   docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v "$(pwd):/app" audio-analyzer
   ```

3. **If X11 Display Issues**:

## üß† Technical Details

### Analysis Pipeline

The audio analysis process follows these steps:

1. **Loading**: Audio is loaded using Essentia's MonoLoader at 44.1kHz
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Spectral analysis using Essentia's Spectrum algorithm
   - MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) for timbre analysis
   - Mel-band energy distribution for frequency analysis
   - HPCP (Harmonic Pitch Class Profile) for key detection
   - Rhythm extraction for BPM and beat patterns
   - Loudness and dissonance calculation

3. **High-Level Feature Derivation**:
   - Mood detection based on key, tempo, and spectral features
   - Instrument detection using spectral characteristics

4. **Description Generation**:
   - Natural language synthesis of all extracted features
   - Thematic suggestions based on detected mood

### NEW: Visualization Pipeline

1. **Audio Processing**: Frame-by-frame analysis using Essentia algorithms
2. **Feature Mapping**: Bass, mid, treble extracted from spectrum analysis
3. **Geometric Generation**: Mathematical functions create precise patterns
4. **Audio Reactivity**: Real-time mapping of audio features to visual parameters
5. **Video Export**: OpenCV-based MP4 generation with customizable quality

### Visualization Types

#### Traditional Analysis Plots
- **Spectrum**: Frequency domain representation of the audio
- **Mel Bands**: Energy distribution across perceptually-weighted frequency bands
- **MFCC**: Coefficients representing the short-term power spectrum

#### NEW: Video Visualizations
- **Frame Rate**: 15-30 FPS for smooth motion
- **Resolution**: 512x512 pixels (customizable)
- **Color Palettes**: Neon and plasma themes optimized for visual impact
- **Audio Synchronization**: Perfect sync between audio features and visual elements

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Essentia 2.1+

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

#### Windows
- If you see "Cannot connect to X server" errors, ensure VcXsrv is running with "Disable access control" checked
- If Windows Defender Firewall prompts appear, allow access for VcXsrv
- For path issues with volume mounts, use forward slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\)
- Use `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` environment variable if GUI doesn't appear

#### Ubuntu
- If you encounter "Cannot open display" errors, try running `xhost +local:docker` before starting the container
- If you see permission issues, ensure your user is in the docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

### NumPy Compatibility Issues

If you see NumPy version errors with Essentia:
```bash
pip install 'numpy<2.0'
```

Essentia requires NumPy 1.x for compatibility.

### Visualization Issues

- **No MP4 output**: Check that OpenCV video writer supports mp4v codec
- **Poor audio reactivity**: Try increasing audio amplitude or adjusting frequency band scaling
- **Performance issues**: Reduce frame rate or duration for faster processing

### Essentia Installation Issues

- Essentia may fail to build on some systems. The Docker approach avoids these issues by using a pre-configured environment
- If building Essentia from source, refer to the [official installation guide](https://essentia.upf.edu/installing.html)
- The info message about missing SVM classifier models is harmless and doesn't affect functionality

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Visualization Styles

The visualization system is designed to be extensible. To add new styles:

1. Create a new generation method in `analyzer/visualizer.py`
2. Add the style to the dropdown in `analyzer/ui/panels.py`
3. Update the style selection logic in `create_visualization_video()`

### Modifying Color Palettes

Edit the `color_palettes` dictionary in `VisualizationGenerator.__init__()` to add new color schemes.

### Adjusting Audio Reactivity

Modify the scaling factors in `extract_frame_features()` to change how responsive the visuals are to different frequency ranges.
